## Prospective PhD Students
<p>We usually take on new PhD students each year. Please do not contact us directly regarding PhD admissions until after you have been admitted, as our admission process is committee-based, and we are unable to respond to emails from individual applicants. We usually begin with an independent study course (CS 899) to get to know each other. For more details, please contact Prof. Sala directly through email after admission.</p>
